 * Matt Wolff
 * MIS579 iLab / Week 5 / Problem 1
 * Requirements:
 * Design, code, and test an application that simulates a screensaver. The application should randomly draw lines 
 * using method drawLine of class Graphics. After drawing 100 lines, the application should clear the screen and 
 * start drawing lines again. To allow the program to draw continuously, place a call to repaint as the last line in 
 * method paintComponent. There could be problems getting this application to function perfectly on any particular 
 * computer system. That would be a good topic for the discussion threads; how well the screen saver works on your 
 * computer.
