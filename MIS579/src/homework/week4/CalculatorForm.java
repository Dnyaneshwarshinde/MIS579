/*
 * Matt Wolff
 * MIS579 iLab / Week 4 / Problem 2
 * Requirements:
 * Write a Java program named CalculatorForm.java that will display a form that does simple numeric calculations. 
 * 
 * The form should successfully do simple integer arithmetic on integer numbers that are input. That is, the program 
 * should work correctly. When the user enters integer input and then presses the calculate button, the program 
 * should display an integer answer in the answer text field. (It's ok to do integer arithmetic and truncate decimal 
 * values.) When the user clicks the exit button or the window-closing button, the program should end.
 * 
 * For right now, assume that the user will only enter integer numbers.

 * If the user does not enter two numbers, or tries to do "division by zero," the program should indicate that 
 * something is invalid.
